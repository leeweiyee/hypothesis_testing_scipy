# Q1) It is expected that 8% of dogs in the FetchMaker system are rescues. Are whippets significantly more or less
# likely to be a rescue?
# get rescue data for whippets:
whippet_rescue = fetchmaker.get_is_rescue("whippet")
# get the number of entries in whippet_rescue that are 1:
num_whippet_rescues = np.count_nonzero(whippet_rescue)
# number of samples in the whippet set:
num_whippets = np.size(whippet_rescue)
# binomial test to test the number of whippet rescues:
pval = binom_test(num_whippet_rescues, n=num_whippets, p=0.08)
print(format(pval, '0.10f')) # p-value is greater than 0.05; cannot say that there is a significant difference
# between the whippets adoption rate and the mean adoption rate

# Q2) Whippets, terriers, and pitbulls are three of the most popular mid-sized dog breeds. Is there a significant
# difference in the average weights of these three dog breeds?
# get weight data for whippets, terriers and pitbulls:
whippet_weight = fetchmaker.get_weight("whippet")
terrier_weight = fetchmaker.get_weight("terrier")
pitbull_weight = fetchmaker.get_weight("pitbull")
# ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference:
fstat, pval2 = f_oneway(whippet_weight, terrier_weight, pitbull_weight)
print(format(pval2, '0.10f')) # p-value is less than 0.05; can say that there is a significant difference between the
# weights of these dog breeds
# Tukeyâ€™s Range Test to determine which of the pairs of these dog breeds differ from each other:
dog_breeds = np.concatenate([whippet_weight, terrier_weight, pitbull_weight])
labels = ['whippet'] * len(whippet_weight) + ['terrier'] * len(terrier_weight) + ['pitbull'] * len(
    pitbull_weight)
tukey_results = pairwise_tukeyhsd(dog_breeds, labels, 0.05)
print(tukey_results) # returns:
#  Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD, FWER=0.05

# Q3) Do poodles and shihtzus have significantly different color breakdowns?
# get poodle colors:

# Chi Square Test to determine if there is a significant difference:

print(format(color_pvalue, '0.10f')) # p-value is less than 0.05; can say that there is a significant difference
